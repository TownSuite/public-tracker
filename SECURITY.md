# Security Policy

## Supported Versions


We release patches for security vulnerabilities.  Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

A LTS release will generally be labeled as with a YEAR.RELEASE format such aa __2022.R1__ or __2022.R2__.
