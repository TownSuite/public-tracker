## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in a TownSuite product? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

1. Bug reports and features can be sent to the support department.
    * Reports that include private/personal/confidential data must be sent to the support department.
2. [Public bug report](https://github.com/TownSuite/public-tracker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)
3. [Public feature request](https://github.com/TownSuite/public-tracker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
4. [Security vulnerability](https://github.com/TownSuite/public-tracker/security/policy)

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/TownSuite/public-tracker/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.



If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* TownSuite product name and version

* Your operating system

* If a web product, please include a list of browser extensions that you have installed 

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* Input data that demonstrates the issue 


### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Web product, Recreate the issue after disabling all web browser extensions

* [ ] Simplify your steps around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the TownSuite internal issue tracking project.   Status changes such as new, in progress, testing, and done can be observed
on your entered issue as labels.

## Automated Issue Management

We use GitHub Actions to help us manage issues.  If you believe the bot got something wrong, please open a new issue and let us know.
